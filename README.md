## Installation
You'll need to install fredapi first. And to do that use this: 

```python
!pip install fredapi
``` 

## Data Sources

* Gross Demostic Product - [GDP series](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP) 
* [Unemployment rate series](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U2RATE)


## **Project Conclusion:**

As anticipated, our analysis reveals a clear relationship between unemployment rates and GDP fluctuations. Notably, during the challenging year of 2020, when unemployment rates surged, we observed a corresponding decline in GDP. 

This observation underscores a fundamental economic principle: "With lower unemployment rates, we are more likely to achieve higher gross domestic product (GDP)."
